            OVERVIEW
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:2em;">
            At Siemens PLM software, I developed usability features for NX. Primarily, I worked on the NXOpen API and the internal autotest framework. My responsibilities included triaging and fixing problem reports, architecting and implementing new features, and developing unit tests to verify the correctness of my changes. Most of my work was done in C++, but I also used (in no particular order) C#, Python, VB, and Java. I collaborated within my team and with others, specifically with QA and QC teams.<br/><br/>
            The NXOpen API is used to programmatically interact with NX. NXOpen supports programs written in C++, Python, C#, Java, and VB. The NXOpen API is automatically generated based on meta files and externally hidden functions written by developers. Most of my development was tied to this API wrapper. I helped to ensure the API was complete and functioned correctly.<br/><br/>
            Additionally, I supported the autotest framework, which relies on the NXOpen API. The autotest framework is used to run over 200,000 automated unit and integration tests. I made performance improvements and added features to this framework.<br/><br/>
            Not all of my learning at Siemens was about software development and engineering. In addition to gaining a lot of valuable development experience, I was able to grow my skills as a team member and leader. In the Fall of 2015, I participated in the Siemens PLM Software corporate hackathon, where my team received an honorable mention. The hackathon was a fantastic example of what it is like to work with a team in a more high pressure environment. In the Spring of 2017, I was able to use a lot of the experience I gained in my 2 previous semesters at Siemens PLM to help onboard some of the newer co-ops.
