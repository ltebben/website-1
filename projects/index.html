            Tiquito (pronounced similarly to "taquito") is a customer service ticket management system for hackathons. My friends and I are some of the leaders of the RevolutionUC oragnizing team. We decided that having a central system for participants to use to ask for help with their projects could really benefit the hackathon. So, we created Tiquito. Tiquito is meant to facilitate making connections between hackathon participants and mentors, and to help hackathon participants get their problems solved. Tiquito includes a web interface at <a href="https://tiquito.com">https://tiquito.com</a>, and desktop and Android clients for administration. Tiquito allows users to submit help requests. Then, mentors and organizers at the hackathon can respond to and manage these requests.

            The project that inspired Tiquito, tIQit (pronounced "ticket") was built in ~24 hours at HackYSU. It was a less complete version of Tiquito, lacking the desktop and Android clients. Like the web portion of Tiquito, it was built using Javascript, Pug, and CSS. It uses a Node.js backend with Express.js and Pug (then known as Jade) for routing and rendering.

            Campus Accessibility is an Android app designed to help people with movement impairments navigate UC's hilly campus. Users are able to place and share map markers at troublesome locations (like steep hills) with descriptions of how to avoid going through that location. Campus Accessibility was written in less than 24 hours at OHI/O.

            Digital Circuit Visualizer is just that - a digital circuit visualizer. It lets users place logic gates (AND, OR, etc) to construct digital circuits and generate tables of input/output combinations for the circuits they built. To analyze only a specific set of inputs, the user can manually set the value of each input node. Digital Circuit Visualizer was my first serious Java project.
