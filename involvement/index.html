            ACM
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:2em;">
            I've been a part of ACM@UC, the University of Cincinnati chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, since my first year at UC. Now, I serve on the exec team as the treasurer. ACM meets every other week during the standard academic year to learn about and discuss an assortment of contemporary computing topics. We hold talks on a variety of subjects - anything from learning how to use git to building a progressive web app. In addition, we hold object oriented programming review sessions with a focus on C++.
            </p><br/>
            <p style="padding-left:2em;">
            My favorite part of my involvement with ACM is leading talks. I give a few talks each year (mostly about using Linux). I also lead all of the OOP review sessions. I have always enjoyed teaching others what I know. It's especially fun because all of the talks I give are on subjects I am passionate about. Also, leading the OOP review sessions is really good for my knowledge of programming. When I'm preparing a review session I often catch myself not knowing smaller details about languages I use. Teacing others helps me keep up with my own knowledge of the languages I use.

            RevolutionUC
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            RevolutionUC is the student hackathon we host at the University of Cincinnati each year. I've been part of RevolutionUC's organizing team for over a year. My position in RevolutionUC is as the leader of the sponsorship team. The sponsorship team is responsible for building relationships with and securing sponsorship from companies interested in hiring UC grads and interns. As the leader of the sponsorship team I write reach out to new potential sponsors, help new members of the sponsorship team learn the ropes, and ensure that our sponsors are satisfied with what they are getting out of sponsoring RevolutionUC. I am also responsible for setting the sponsorship tiers and writing sponsorship documents.

            <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            I love the work I do with RevolutionUC. I enjoy building a network of companies who want to get connected with UC students. I also like meeting new people in the CS community. I get to do a lot of those things as the head of the sponsorship team. Building a large CS community at UC is really important to me. RevolutionUC is one of the best ways to do that - and it's the largest CS event at UC.
